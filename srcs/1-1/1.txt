An example of the hypothesized association in (a) frame 230 and (b)
frame 233; the blue boxes represent the detections, and the red box is the
inserted hypothesized association.

9
An example of the depth map, showing (a) detections and (b)
depth map, where higher intensity indicates detected pedestrians are closer
to the camera

The classifier response (heat map) visualized for one tracking
target (white). As the classifier is adapted continuously, it becomes more
discriminative (right: 20 frames later)

 Network input and output: (a) Background image of the input pair. (b) Input frame. (c) Network output.

 The proposed deep learning framework for motion
segmentation from a moving stereo camera.

 Overview of the Proposed Method of Recurrent
FCN. The recurrent part is unrolled for better visualisation
